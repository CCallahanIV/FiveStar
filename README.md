MVP: A web based application that will return to the user the five closest five-star rated restaurants.

  USER STORY: As a user, I want to, in as few steps as possible, know the five closest five star - rated restaurants to me.  From this list, I want to select a restaurant and know more information, including how to get there.

DATA-SOURCE(s): Draw from the Yelp API.  As a backup, draw from google.
